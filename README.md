#### Objective
The object of the Ant Defense is to prevent the ants from making it across the screen to the cake on the left side.

### The Inspiration
Ant Defense is our final project for AP Computer Science.  
It is a spinoff of the popular game, [*Plants v. Zombies*](http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-1).

Earlier in our AP Computer Science class, we had to created a program called [Ant Farm](http://www.garfieldcs.com/2010/04/ant-farm-gridworld-project/).
From that moment on, ants became almost like an inside joke among the Computer Science students.  
So much so that we even got an Ant Farm as a class pet!  

So, for our final project, we felt as though it was necessary to incorporate ants and thus, Ant Defense was born!
